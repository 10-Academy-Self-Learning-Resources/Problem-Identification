# Problem-Identification
Understands how to predict the emergence of future, business-relevant (or project relevant) issues and develop solutions to solve them, including projecting the consequences and potential impact of doing one thing over another, or of doing nothing at all.  

## What is Problem Identification
The process of deteecting issues/problems before it causes a major disaster is problem identification

## When will I use Problem Identification in my ML career
Being able to detect or forsee the kind of problems a certain ML model can encounter in production or development stage is a vital skill that could save company millions of dollars. Another use case would be building a pipeline for data collection and preprocessing. The ability to factor in all major bug-like issue that the pipeline may encounter enable you to build a robust pipeline that in some way is bug tolerant. 

## Why is it important to learn about Problem Identification before starting my ML career
It is very important to be able to identify problems in any career. Being able to do so as a ML engineer or Data Engineer/Scientist, will give you the ability to build tools and solutions that are
   - robust, 
   - work for many use cases with minimal changes,
   - can withsand the test of time and
   - saves alot of money for your company

## How Problem Identification help solve problem
Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution.
