# Problem-Identification
Understands how to predict the emergence of future, business-relevant (or project relevant) issues and develop solutions to solve them, including projecting the consequences and potential impact of doing one thing over another, or of doing nothing at all.  

## What is Problem Identification
The process of detecting issues/problems before it causes a major disaster is problem identification. Not only a major disaster, but also forseeing the impacts of the work that one does, ideally a few steps ahead, almost like a chess player looks steps ahead.  

Steps in problem identification framework
- Problem Definition: Define what the problem looks like
- Plan Development: Develop steps to take to arrive at a good acceptable solutions NB solution can be more than one
- Plan Implementation: Execute listed steps above
- Plan Evaluation: Measure how good/effective the solution(s) you have created is/are

## When will I use Problem Identification in my ML career
Being able to detect or forsee the kind of problems a certain ML model can encounter in production or development stage is a vital skill that could save company millions of dollars. Another use case would be building a pipeline for data collection and preprocessing. The ability to factor in all major bug-like issue that the pipeline may encounter enable you to build a robust pipeline that in some way is bug tolerant. 

++Can you please do some research into problem-identification vs. problem identification

## Why is it important to learn about Problem Identification before starting my ML career
It is very important to be able to identify problems in any career. Being able to do so as a ML engineer or Data Engineer/Scientist, will give you the ability to build tools and solutions that are
   - robust, 
   - work for many use cases with minimal changes,
   - can withsand the test of time and
   - saves alot of money for your company
- Will allow you do more than just what you are specifically asked to do - rather, it is a mindset that will ask you to look at the system and predict potential future issues.
- ML is full of experiments that may or may not work and may be full of experiments that may take a lot longer to deliver results than originally expected
- ML can also result in unexpected outcomes (look at the Microsoft Tay chatbot for example)

++Relationship between management qualities and problem-identification.

## How Problem Identification help solve problem
Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution.<br>
Problem Identification also helps in preventing future issues/problem by identifying them early in any project phase. It helps you prepare for the unforseen situations.

## Examples of how you probably use Problem Identification today
**Thinking**: You taking the time to think about what to do when to do and how to do is an example of you using your problem identification skills to plan your work.

++We can add more here later.

## What components makes up Problem Identification
- Definition
- Root cause understanding
- Setting Priorities
- Execute the Plan

++We need to think this through further.

## What differentiates begineers from experts in Problem Identification
- Experts
  - Detecting the smallest kind of problem that could occur in a project
  - Using Proper planning to cross check each stage of a project
  - Can look further into the future
  - Has a good idea of scope

- Begineer
  - Can use problem identification to formulate project goals and objectives
